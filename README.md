Bump
=============

A package allows to preview and manage latest versions of [npm](https://npmjs.com)/[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) packages easily.
Inspired by the vscode feature, but was rethought and enhanced.

For now, it allows:

- Show **latest** released package version.
- Show **next** (alpha, beta, etc) package version.
- Compare semver versions and detect whether or not current version should be updated.
- Format to **latest** or **next** version from the context menu.
- Use custom registries.
- Customize tooltip for your needs and taste.

## Installation

#### Install Bump via Package Control

The easiest and recommended way to install Bump is using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Bump).

From the **main application menu** (CMD + SHIFT + P), navigate to:

`Tools` -> `Command Palette...` -> `Package Control: Install Package`, type the word **Bump**, then select it to complete the installation.

#### Manual installation

##### via archive
1. Download and extract Bump [zip file](https://github.com/yavorsky/Bump/archive/master.zip) to your Sublime Text Packages directory (Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...).
2. Rename the extracted directory from `Bump-master` to `Bump`.

##### or via git clone
`git clone https://github.com/yavorsky/Bump.git $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/Bump`

## Usage

Just install the package and focus the line with dependency in `package.json`. Bump will preview latest or next version (according to the distribution mode) of the package in the bottombar or with the tooltip.

#### Main features:

* **Focus the line** inside `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies`/`optionalDependencies` block to preview latest or next version of the package. If tooltip option in settings is `false` then version will be displayed in the bottom bar.
* **Click on the version in the tooltip** to format current version to the one from tooltip.
* **Click on Bump -> Format to...** latest/next version from the context menu.
* **Choose distribution mode** to change whether or not to fetch unreleased (alpha/beta/etc) version before relaesed.


## Settings

Many options are customizable from the **Command Palette** (super + shift + p) and type **Bump**.

#### distribution_mode

Type: *String*, Default: `latest`

Command: `Choose distribution mode`.

Currently, Bump supports `latest` and `next` distribution tags. By default, the `latest` tag is used by npm to identify the current version of a package. The `next` tag is used by some projects to identify the upcoming version (alpha, beta, etc). 

With `next` mode, package trying to fetch latest version, and if no one was registered, it fallbacks to the `latest` version.


#### tooltip

Type: *Boolean*, Default: `true`

Whether or not show tooltip near the cursor. If tooltip is disabled, the version would be displayed in the botombar.


#### dependency_fields

Type: *Array*, Default: `["dependencies", "devDependencies", "peerDependencies"]`

Field name, where Bump will search and show latest version for current package.


#### supported_filenames

Type: *Array*, Default: `["package.json"]`

Name of the files when Bump will watch out for your cursor. We haven't universal parser for all formats, but with json files it does its work.


## Key Bindings

Bump has pre-defined keyboard shortcuts. For now, it format package value on the line with the cursor.

| Command          | Linux & Windows | MacOS          |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Format to latest | CTRL + B + K    | CTRL + CMD + , |
| Format to next   | CTRL + B + L    | CTRL + CMD + . |
