SublimeBump
=============

A package allows to manage [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) dependencies easily.
Inspired by the vscode feature, but was rethought and enhanced.

For now, it allows:

- Show **latest** released package version.

- Show **next** (alpha, beta, etc) package version.

- Format to **latest** or **next** version from the editor view.

- Use custom registries.

- Customize tooltip for your needs and taste.

## Installation

The easiest and recommended way to install JsPrettier is using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JsPrettier).

From the **main application menu**, navigate to:

`Tools` -> `Command Palette...` -> `Package Control: Install Package`, type the word **SublimeBump**, then select it to complete the installation.


## Usage

Just install the package and focus the line with dependency in `package.json`. SublimeBump will preview latest or next version (according to the distribution mode) of the package in the bottombar or with the tooltip.


## Settings

Many options are customizable from the **Command Palette** (super + shift + p) and type **SublimeBump**.

#### distribution_mode

Type: *String*, Default: `latest`

Command: `Choose distribution mode`.

Currently, SublimeBump supports `latest` and `next` distribution tags. By default, the `latest` tag is used by npm to identify the current version of a package. The `next` tag is used by some projects to identify the upcoming version (alpha, beta, etc). 

With `next` mode, package trying to fetch latest version, and if no one was registered, it fallbacks to the `latest` version.


#### tooltip

Type: *Boolean*, Default: `true`

Whether or not show tooltip near the cursor. If tooltip is disabled, the version would be displayed in the botombar.


#### dependency_fields

Type: *Array*, Default: `["dependencies", "devDependencies", "peerDependencies"]`

Field name, where SublimeBump will search and show latest version for current package.


#### supported_filenames

Type: *Array*, Default: `["package.json"]`

Name of the files when SublimeBump will watch out for your cursor. We haven't universal parser for all formats, but with json files it does its work.


## Key Bindings

SublimeBump has pre-defined keyboard shortcuts. For now, it format package value on the line with the cursor.

| Command          | Linux & Windows | MacOS          |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Format to latest | CTRL + K + ,    | CTRL + CMD + , |
| Format to next   | CTRL + K + .    | CTRL + CMD + . |
